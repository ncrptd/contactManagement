# Contact Management Frontend

This is a React application that interacts with the Contact Management API, allowing users to manage their contacts, including adding, editing, deleting, updating, and searching for contacts.


Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/)
- Git installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/ncrptd/contactManagement
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd contactManagement
   npm install
   ```


   Update the `REACT_APP_API_URL` value with the base URL of your Contact Management API.

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Features

- Display a list of contacts with their names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
- Provide a form to add new contacts, including fields for name, phone number, and email address.
- Implement the ability to edit, delete, update, and download contacts.
- Add search functionality to allow users to search for contacts by name.
- Implement sorting options to sort contacts by name or other relevant criteria.

## State Management

This application uses React's `useContext` and `useReducer` for state management, allowing for efficient management of global application state.

## API Calls

Axios is used to make API calls to the Contact Management API. The base URL for API calls is defined in the `.env` file.
